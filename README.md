# DS_FinalProject

A simple CLI project for my DataStructure & Algorithms university course project

### Contents ###
- implemetation of graph (in Java of course)
- applied DFS traveral algorithm on the graph
- applied the Dijkastra algorithm on the graph

## command line input Guide ##
1. first, you have to create a graph; this is the format of the vertices,edges & weights:

`[Number of nodes] [Number of edges]`

`[Line of node Numbers]`

`[First node number] [Second node number] [cost of the edge between first and second node]`

2. for the rest of app you can use the `join [number of vertices,...]` or `test` keywords.
3. you will have a cli menu and guide in app after initializing graph

*Enjoy the App*
